    <title>Python Game Project</title>
</head>
<body>
    My first game in python was a text based fantasy/adventure game called The Land Of Jaltar.
    You play as 1 of 6 races and go through your world getting more loot and better weapons along the way
    My game has a currency system and includes many aspects that I think other games lack.
    
    Weapons:
    My game includes 3 weapons that you can choose from:
    1 the knife
    2 the sword
    3 the staff
    
    the 6 races are:
    1 human
    2 demon
    3 dwarf
    4 gooblin
    5 paper doode
    6 elf
    
    the classes are:
    1 rogue
    2 warlock
    3 warrior
